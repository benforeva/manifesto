# Hacking the Namespace Manifesto


### Background
Ready to get hacking on some philisophy? Great!

Here is the gist of things around here (no pun intended):

This manifesto could be seen as sort of a code of conduct for developers down with the Namespace App Club movement.
While we won't execute you if you don't adhere to it (we may not execute your code though) we will probably have
a better industry if we all do.

### Great but how do I hack this document?

I'm getting to that; the manifesto itself is recorded in the MANIFESTO.md file. To encourage collaboration, we make 
edits via [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). That means if you want to put something in or take something out, submit a pull request.

Let everyone know what you have been up to and we will comment with a `+1` to show approval. If someone disagrees, take
it to the comments section. 

### What happens if nobody responds?

If after some days nobody objects, it will be merged. No sense in keeping back progress.

### Siging off

Once you have contributed to this glorious manifesto, you should see the AUTHORS.md file. Leave your name and a link to
your website, twitter, LinkedIn or whatever so people know you were part of this.

Happy hacking!
